This codebase includes two primary components: SignUp and Login, developed using React, React Router, Axios, and modular components like Input, Button, Modal, and Spinner. The architecture is clean, scalable, and designed for integration with a global state management system (React useContext) to display user informations at admin dashboard and also at user profile page.
